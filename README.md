# Data Science Capstone Case Studies

This repository contains three case studies completed as part of the DSDA 310 Senior Seminar at Beloit College. These projects showcase applications of data science in education policy, YouTube analytics, and medical signal processing using convolutional neural networks. These projects demonstrate my ability to apply advanced data science and analytics techniques to real-world challenges, showcasing my commitment to learning beyond my primary discipline and my capability to tackle complex data-driven problems. I would be happy to answer any questions regarding the below case studies. 

## Overview of the case studies

1. ### **[Insights from Early Childhood Education Data]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11-49UPlcJes_913MUc8_oBSxSheSbzvV/view))**

This study examines the impact of various demographic and educational factors on the academic performance of third-grade students within the Beloit School District, which currently ranks among the lowest-performing districts in terms of academic achievement.


2. ### **[Analyzing Streaming Media Performance, Viewership and Demographics for Layers of Return on Investment]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9_EeZXjTf5FPzcKcpr11jrrnonO1N2u/view))**

This case study analyzes the performance metrics and viewership demographics associated with the Client’s Youtube channel to identify data-driven success stories and their implications for Return on Investment (ROI). Conducted under the supervision of a Consulting firm, this analysis will help clients evaluate and assess whether a principal funding partner should continue their investment, directly or indirectly influencing the operational & financial strategies of the channel’s production.

3. ### **[Detecting Epileptic Seizures from the Electroencephalogram (EEG) Data through CNN Model]([url](https://drive.google.com/file/d/108uX7PaabRWZUsdDG_z2ohFYK6r56Puw/view))**

This case study aims to leverage ML and data science computational techniques to detect seizures using EEG data. Seizures, which result from abnormal electrical activity in the brain, can significantly impact individuals' health and quality of life. Timely and accurate seizure detection is essential for effective intervention and improved clinical outcomes. EEG data, a method for recording brain activity, serves as a valuable tool for identifying seizure events.
